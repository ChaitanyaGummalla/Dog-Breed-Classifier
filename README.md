# Dog Breed Classifier

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model capable of classifying dog breeds with high accuracy. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it employs the extensive Stanford dog dataset, which comprises 20,580 images spanning 120 different dog breeds.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an overall accuracy of 90%.
- **Robust Performance**: Capable of recognizing breeds in photos of varying quality, including low-resolution images.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), which includes a diverse set of images representing 120 different dog breeds.

## Model
The classifier uses a CNN architecture, fine-tuned for the task of identifying various dog breeds with high precision.

## Usage
To use this classifier, refer to the `Code.ipynb` notebook in this repository, which includes detailed instructions and code to run the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: (you may list required libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, etc., that are necessary to run the model)
